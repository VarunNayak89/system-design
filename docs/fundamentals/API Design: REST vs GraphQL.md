# What is API Design?

API design defines how clients interact with backend services.  
Two popular approaches are:

- **REST** (Representational State Transfer)  
- **GraphQL** (Query Language for APIs)

## ðŸ§  REST Overview

### âœ… Characteristics
- Resource-based: Each endpoint represents a resource.  
- Uses HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.  
- Stateless: Each request is independent.  
- Responses are typically in JSON.

### ðŸ§ª Example
*(Example can be added here as needed.)*

## ðŸ§  GraphQL Overview

### âœ… Characteristics
- Single endpoint: `/graphql`  
- Clients define the shape of the response.  
- Strongly typed schema.  
- Supports queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

### ðŸ§ª Example
*(Example can be added here as needed.)*

## ðŸ“Š REST vs GraphQL Comparison

| Feature | REST | GraphQL |
|----------|------|----------|
| Data Fetching | Fixed structure per endpoint | Client specifies exact fields |
| Over/Under-fetching | Common | Avoided |
| Endpoints | Multiple | Single (`/graphql`) |
| Versioning | URI versioning (`/v1/`) | Schema evolution via types |
| Error Handling | HTTP status codes | Custom error objects |
| Caching | Easy with HTTP | More complex |
| Tooling | Postman, Swagger | GraphiQL, Banana Cake Pop |
| Learning Curve | Easier | Requires schema/query knowledge |

## ðŸ§  System Design Relevance

GraphQL is primarily an API implementation choice, not a system design strategy.  
However, it influences design in areas such as:

- Data fetching efficiency  
- Backend orchestration  
- Caching strategies  
- Security and access control

## ðŸ”§ GraphQL Implementation in C# with HotChocolate

### âœ… Steps
1. Create a New Project  
2. Install **HotChocolate**  
3. Define a Data Model  
4. Create a Query Resolver  
5. Configure GraphQL in `Program.cs`  
6. Run and Test  

- Navigate to: [http://localhost:5000/graphql](http://localhost:5000/graphql)  
- Use **Banana Cake Pop** to test queries.  

âœ… **Response:** *(Add example response here)*

## ðŸ§  Summary

| Aspect | REST | GraphQL |
|---------|------|----------|
| System Design Impact | Minimal | Moderate (depends on usage) |
| Implementation | HTTP endpoints, controllers | Schema, resolvers, query engine |
| C# Support | ASP.NET Core Web API | HotChocolate, GraphQL.NET |
