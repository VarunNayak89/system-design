# ⚙️ What is gRPC?

gRPC is a **high-performance**, open-source **remote procedure call (RPC)** framework developed by **Google**.  
It allows communication between services in a fast, efficient, and language-agnostic way — often used in **microservices** and **real-time systems**.

---

## 🧠 Think of it like
Instead of calling a REST API over HTTP/JSON, with **gRPC**, you're calling a function on another service as if it were **local** — but it's actually **remote**.

---

## 🔍 How It Works (in Simple Terms)

1. You define your APIs and data structures using a `.proto` file (**Protocol Buffers**).  
2. gRPC auto-generates client and server code in multiple languages.  
3. Your client app calls a method (e.g., `getUser()`), and gRPC handles:
   - Serialization  
   - Network communication  
   - Deserialization  
4. It runs over **HTTP/2**, which enables:  
   - Multiplexing (multiple calls on one connection)  
   - Streaming (client, server, or both)

## 🆚 gRPC vs REST

| Feature | gRPC | REST |
|----------|------|------|
| **Protocol** | HTTP/2 | HTTP/1.1 |
| **Data Format** | Protocol Buffers (binary) | JSON |
| **Speed** | Very Fast (binary + compact) | Slower (text-based) |
| **API Definition** | `.proto` file | OpenAPI/Swagger (optional) |
| **Streaming Support** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Limited (need workarounds) |
| **Language Support** | Multi-language auto-gen | Manual SDKs needed |
| **Use Case Fit** | Microservices, low-latency | Public APIs, browser apps |

## 📦 Real-world Use Cases

- Microservices talking to each other internally  
- Real-time location tracking (e.g., Uber)  
- Low-latency mobile-to-backend communication  
- IoT systems  
- Video/audio streaming

## 🧑‍💻 Sample `.proto` Definition

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}

message UserRequest {
  string user_id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
}
```

> This generates `GetUser()` method in your client/server code.

## ✅ Summary

gRPC is a **modern, efficient, and scalable** alternative to REST — ideal for **high-performance internal service communication**, especially when you need **speed**, **streaming**, and **strong contracts** between services.
